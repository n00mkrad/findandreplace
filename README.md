# About this fork

This is a little modification of FNR, with the following changes:

- **Dark theme** so you don't go blind
- Ability to **Drag-n-Drop** files from the result list into other applications (e.g. for editing code or pasting into a terminal)
- **Cleaner UI layout** with more spaces where it matters

# What's Find and Replace (FNR)?
Find and Replace (FNR) is an open source tool to find and replace text in multiple files. It can quickly search through large numbers of files and also find the information using regular expressions specifying the form of what you want, instead of literal text.
